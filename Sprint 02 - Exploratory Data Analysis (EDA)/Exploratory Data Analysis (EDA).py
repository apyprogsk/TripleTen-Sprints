# **Please, use some color other than those listed to highlight answers to my comments.**
# I would also ask you **not to change, move or delete my comments** so that it would be easier for me to navigate during the next review.
#     
# In addition, my comments are defined as headings. 
# They can mess up the content; however, they are convenient, since you can immediately go to them. I will remove the headings from my comments in the next review.

# <font color='dodgerblue'>**A few words about the project:**</font> you did a good job, everything is clear and neat. The project is easy to read, which is definitely a plus. There are a lot graphs. It is good, visualization never hurts. I still have some questions that I've written in my comments. I've also left there some recommendations for improving the project.

# üìå Here are some hints that may help you with Markdown cells:    
# <hr style="border-top: 3px solid purple; "></hr>
# 
# You can leave comments using this code inside a Markdown cell:
#     
#     
#     <div class="alert alert-info">
#     <h2> Student's comment</h2>
# 
#     Your text here.

#     
#     
#     <font color='red'> This code is used to change text color. </font>     
# 
# <font color='red'> It will look like this. </font> 
#     
# If you don't want your comments to be headings, replace **h2** with **b** or just add `<a class="tocSkip">` after the phrase *Student's comment*.

# Project Description
# The goal of this project is to gain insights into customer shopping habits, identify popular products, understand reorder behavior, and explore temporal trends in order placement. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that can inform business decisions and improve customer experience on the Instacart platform.
# Data Description
# 
# The dataset consists of five tables:
# instacart_orders.csv: Contains information about each customer order, including order ID, user ID, order number, day of the week, hour of the day, and days since the prior order.
# 
# products.csv: Provides details about individual products, such as product ID, product name, aisle ID, and department ID.
# 
# order_products.csv: Specifies which products were included in each order, along with additional details such as add-to-cart order and reorder status.
# 
# aisles.csv: Includes a list of aisle IDs and corresponding aisle names.
# 
# departments.csv: Contains department IDs and corresponding department names.
# 
# 
# Tasks Performed
# The project encompasses various tasks, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Key tasks include verifying and cleaning data, analyzing order patterns by hour and day of the week, identifying popular products, exploring reorder behavior, and investigating shopping trends over time.
# 
# By conducting thorough analysis and interpretation of the Instacart dataset, we aim to provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer satisfaction.

# CONCLUSION:
# 
# Based on the information provided from the database files:
# 
# The data seems to be structured into several tables:
# 
# Orders Table: Contains information about orders such as order ID, user ID, order number, day of the week the order was made, hour of the day the order was made, and days since the prior order. It appears that there are some missing values in the "days_since_prior_order" column.
# 
# Products Table: This table lists product details including product ID, product name, aisle ID, and department ID. It seems that there are some missing values in the "product_name" column.
# 
# Order Products Table: Contains details about products added to each order, including the order ID, product ID, order in which the product was added to the cart, and whether the product was reordered.
# 
# Aisles Table: Provides information about different aisles, including aisle ID and aisle name.
# 
# Departments Table: Contains details about different departments, including department ID and department name.
# 
# Intermediate Conclusion:
# The database consists of several tables containing information about orders, products, aisles, and departments. Further analysis could involve examining relationships between these tables, such as which products are frequently reordered, which departments have the highest sales, or which aisles are most commonly visited. Additionally, data cleaning may be necessary to handle missing values in certain columns.

# This could involve standardizing naming conventions, resolving discrepancies, or updating incorrect entries and documenting the process of identifying and resolving duplicate product names is crucial for transparency and reproducibility. This documentation can help future users understand the dataset's quality and any modifications made to it.

# Great! Now we are ready for the exploratory data analysis. 
# 
# </div>

# # [A] Easy (must complete all to pass)

# ### [A1] Verify that the `'order_hour_of_day'` and `'order_dow'` values in the `orders` tables are sensible (i.e. `'order_hour_of_day'` ranges from 0 to 23 and `'order_dow'` ranges from 0 to 6)

# In[37]:


# Check for any outliers or invalid values in 'order_hour_of_day'
invalid_hour_values = instacart_orders_df[
    (instacart_orders_df['order_hour_of_day'] < 0) | 
    (instacart_orders_df['order_hour_of_day'] > 23)
]

# Check for any outliers or invalid values in 'order_dow'
invalid_dow_values = instacart_orders_df[
    (instacart_orders_df['order_dow'] < 0) | 
    (instacart_orders_df['order_dow'] > 6)
]

if invalid_hour_values.empty and invalid_dow_values.empty:
    print("All 'order_hour_of_day' and 'order_dow' values are sensible.")
else:
    print("There are outliers or invalid values in 'order_hour_of_day' or 'order_dow'.")


# ## Conclusion
# 
# All 'order_hour_of_day' and 'order_dow' values in the orders table are sensible. The 'order_hour_of_day' values range from 0 to 23, representing the hours of the day when orders were placed. Similarly, the 'order_dow' values range from 0 to 6, representing the days of the week (0 being Sunday and 6 being Saturday) when orders were placed. These ranges align with expected values and indicate that the data is consistent and suitable for further analysis.

# Conclusion:
# 
# The histogram reveals interesting patterns in the frequency of grocery shopping by day of the week. Remarkably, the analysis shows that the highest frequency of orders occurs on Sunday and Monday, indicating significant shopping activity at the beginning and end of the traditional week. Conversely, the order frequencies on the remaining days of the week appear relatively uniform, suggesting consistent but less pronounced shopping behavior. This observation aligns with common shopping trends, where consumers may engage in more extensive grocery shopping over the weekend to prepare for the upcoming week. The histogram's clear labels, including rotated x-axis tick labels for improved readability, enhance its interpretability, facilitating a nuanced understanding of shopping behavior across different days of the week. Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution of grocery shopping activity throughout the week, underscoring the significance of Sunday and Monday as peak shopping days.

# ### [A4] How long do people wait until placing another order?

# In[40]:


# Filter out the first orders (where days_since_prior_order is null)

plt.xlabel('Days Since Prior Order')
plt.ylabel('No of Orders')
plt.grid(alpha=0.7)
plt.show()


# 

# Conclusion:
# 
# The histogram reveals interesting patterns in the frequency of days elapsed since the previous order. Notably, the analysis indicates that the highest frequency of orders occurs on the 30th day since the prior order, suggesting a significant proportion of customers placing orders monthly. Additionally, there is a notable peak in order frequency observed within the 3rd to 9th day range, possibly indicating a weekly shopping pattern for some customers. However, order frequencies decline considerably after the 15th day, with relatively few orders observed beyond this point. This observation suggests that a significant portion of customers may prefer to shop more frequently, with longer intervals between orders being less common. Overall, the histogram provides valuable insights into the distribution of days elapsed between orders, highlighting distinct patterns in customer shopping behavior.

plt.title('Distribution of Orders Per Customer')
plt.xlabel('Number of Orders')
plt.ylabel('No of Orders')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()


# 

# Conclusion:
# 
# The histogram illustrates a skewed distribution of the number of orders per customer, with a significant proportion of customers having only one order. This suggests that a large number of customers may be occasional shoppers or may have made only a single purchase on the platform. Subsequently, the frequency of customers decreases gradually as the number of orders per customer increases, indicating that fewer customers place multiple orders. By the middle of the month, the frequency of customers with higher numbers of orders diminishes substantially, implying a decline in customer engagement or retention over time. Overall, the analysis provides insights into the distribution of customer order behavior, highlighting the prevalence of occasional shoppers and the challenges associated with retaining customers for multiple transactions.

# CONCLUSION:
# 
# From the output showing the proportion of reordered orders for each product, we can observe the following:
# 
# The product_id column represents the unique identifier for each product.
# The order_id column represents the proportion of reordered orders for each product. However, there seems to be some missing values in this column.
# The product_name column contains the names of the products.
# Conclusion:
# 
# The proportion of reordered orders varies across different products.
# Some products have a high proportion of reordered orders, indicating that they are frequently repurchased by customers.
# Other products have a lower proportion of reordered orders, suggesting that they may be purchased less frequently or may not be as popular among customers.
# Further analysis can be conducted to understand the factors influencing the reordering behavior of customers and to identify strategies for improving product retention and customer satisfaction.
