    "<b> Project Overview: OilyGiant Mining Company Well Location Analysis </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Objective: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify the most profitable region for developing new oil wells for OilyGiant mining company. We are tasked with analyzing oil well data from three different regions to determine which location offers the best combination of high returns and low risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Data: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have geological exploration data for three regions, each containing information on 100,000 oil wells. The data includes features of each well (f0, f1, f2) and the volume of reserves (product) in thousands of barrels.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Methodology: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: Load and examine the data from all three regions. <br>\n",
    "Model Development: Create a linear regression model for each region to predict oil reserves based on well features. <br>\n",
    "Profit Calculation: Determine the break-even point and calculate potential profits for the top 200 wells in each region. <br>\n",
    "Risk Assessment: Use bootstrapping to estimate the distribution of profits and assess the risk of losses for each region. <br>\n",
    "Region Selection: Choose the best region based on the highest average profit with a risk of loss below 2.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> KEY CONDITIONS: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Budget: </b> 100 million dollars for developing 200 oil wells <br>\n",
    "<b> Revenue: </b> 4,500 dollars per thousand barrels of oil <br>\n",
    "<b> Model Constraint: </b> Only linear regression is suitable for predictions <br>\n",
    "<b> Well Selection: </b> 200 best wells are chosen out of 500 explored in each region <br>\n",
    "<b> Risk Threshold: </b> Regions with over 2.5% risk of loss are disqualified\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Expected Outcome: </b>\n",
    "By the end of this analysis, we will recommend the most suitable region for OilyGiant to develop new oil wells, balancing the potential for high profits with an acceptable level of risk."
